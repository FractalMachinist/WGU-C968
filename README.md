# 'In The Loupe' WGU Capstone Project
This project demonstrates a cohesive understanding of how software engineering, machine learning, and data engineering integrate with business needs and processes.

The project begins with a project proposal (Zach Allen - WGU C964 - Project Proposal - v1.pdf) and executive summary (Zach Allen - WGU C964 - Executive Summary - v1.pdf), then produces the project's final report (In The Loupe Phase 1 Report.ipynb).
